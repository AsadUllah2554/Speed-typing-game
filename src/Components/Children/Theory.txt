For understanding:
<h1> Hello World</h1> this is not a self closing tag
<NavBar/> This is a self closing tag which is our custom component.
Suppose you want a component with a border and Inside it you want to render
different things like h1 div or form depending on the use in App.

You can do this. 
Suppose we create a border box component
in <BorderBox> component pass props and return {props.children} and boom you are done

<BorderBox> <h1>Hello</h1></BorderBox>
<BorderBox> <div>Hello</div></BorderBox>
